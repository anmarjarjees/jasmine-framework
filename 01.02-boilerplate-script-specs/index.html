    <!-- 
    Now again, the order is important.
We need to load our source code, our calc.js, before we load the specifications.
The reason for this is that any functions or objects that we define within the calc.js file will be referenced inside our calcSpec.js file.

<!-- Notice that this HTML file doesn't actually have a <body> element.
        That's because it's not strictly needed.
        It's still perfectly valid HTML, and Jasmine will take care of that for us. -->
